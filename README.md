# Forest Wandering
Soundscape Narrative for ENGCMP 0610


Forest Wandering is an audio piece that focuses on the narrative of using nature as a form of escape. Nature in itself has been seen as time goes on as disparate from the bustling metropolitan areas that make up a significant portion of people's lives. Exploring nature and forests around me have always been really relaxing and adventurous for me, and so I thought I'd share that feeling with this piece. While creating this piece, I spent a lot of time trying to find the right sounds to use across the internet, and even considered fabricating some from nature around me, but I was unable to find a time and a place to record truly accurate sounds, and because of that I see some significant avenues for improvement. I did happen to find a happy medium in music, however. Using a platform called Musescore, I was able to edit sheet music and play it back at a high level of quality that I could easily include in the project. I limited myself to spending an hour or two messing about with the music, so I can create the haphazard exploratory vibe that I feel when I explore these open forest areas. Upon further feedback, I recalled my time playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and noted how they used notes played on various instruments that were then reversed, which I decided to insert into an earlier portion of the audio piece. Working with the platform was quite straightforward, and I only experienced minor issues throughout the development of the work. I only hope that the experience created from listening to this piece gives off the energy I intended to create.
